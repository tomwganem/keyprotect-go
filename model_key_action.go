/*
 * IBM Key Protect API
 *
 * IBM Key Protect helps you provision encrypted keys for apps across IBM Cloud. As you manage the lifecycle of your keys, you can benefit from knowing that your keys are secured by cloud-based FIPS 140-2 Level 2 hardware security modules (HSMs) that protect against theft of information. You can use the Key Protect API to store, generate, and retrieve your key material. Keys within the service can protect any type of data in your symmetric key based encryption solution.

// The base request for key actions.
type KeyAction struct {
	// The data encryption key (DEK) used in wrap actions when the query parameter is set to `wrap`. The system returns a base64 encoded plaintext in the response entity-body when you perform an `unwrap` action on a key.     To wrap an existing DEK, provide a base64 encoded plaintext during a `wrap` action. To generate a new DEK, omit the `plaintext` property. Key Protect generates a random plaintext (32 bytes) that is rooted in an HSM and then wraps that value.
	Plaintext *os.File `json:"plaintext,omitempty"`
	// The additional authentication data (AAD) used to further secure the key.     If you supply AAD when you make a `wrap` call, you must specify the same AAD during a subsequent `unwrap` call.
	Aad []string `json:"aad,omitempty"`
	// The wrapped data encryption key (DEK) used in wrap actions when the query parameter is set to `unwrap`. The system requires a base64 encoded ciphertext and returns a base64 encoded plaintext in the response entity-body when you perform an `unwrap` action on a key.       **Note:** When you unwrap a wrapped data encryption key (WDEK) by using a rotated root key, the service returns a new ciphertext in the response entity-body. Each ciphertext remains available for `unwrap` actions. If you unwrap a DEK with a previous ciphertext, the service also returns the latest ciphertext in the response.  Use the latest ciphertext for future unwrap operations.
	Ciphertext *os.File `json:"ciphertext,omitempty"`
	// The key material that you want to import into the service for rotating an existing root key. This value is  required for a `rotate` action if you initially imported the key material when you created the key.     To rotate an imported root key, provide a base64 encoded payload in the request entity-body. To rotate a root key that was initially generated by Key Protect, omit the `payload` property and pass in an empty request entity-body.
	Payload *os.File `json:"payload,omitempty"`
